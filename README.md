ColorStack Winter Break Hackathon Edition 2025

https://colorstackwinterhack2025-ai-wrapped.vercel.app/

## Description
AI Wrapped is a Chrome extension that generates a weekly digest of how users interacted with AI over the past week. Each weekly report includes the total number of AI prompts, the top prompt categories, responsible AI signals, and reflections on AI usage.

## Problem
We have started to incorporate AI tools into our workflows, but we often fail to reflect on how frequently we rely on these tools. Discussions about responsible AI often focus on models and policies, but rarely on user behaviors.

## Solution
Inspired by Spotify Wrapped, our solution provides a weekly summary of AI usage patterns and their associated effects. Each weekly report displays metrics of AI interactions and offers insights that promote responsible AI usage.

## Usage Instructions and Features
1.	Click on "Manage Tracking" to start/stop tracking of AI usage
2.	Click on "View This Week's Wrapped" to view usage summary
3.	Click on "Go to Graph/Text Summary" to switch between text/graph view of summary
